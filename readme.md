For my solution I used Clean Architecture appraoch i.e. Clean architecture was a bit of an overkill since it is a small applicaion but I prefered it because it helps with organising my code and advantages such as


1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clean Architecture separates the application into distinct layers which inturn makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. **Flexibility**: allowing toeasily swap out specific implementations without affecting the rest of the application. 

3. **Testability**: easy to test since they are isolated

To run the application, you need to:
Select TopScorers.Main as the startup project and run the application.
follow the prompt to input file path for the file containing the list of players and their scores.
